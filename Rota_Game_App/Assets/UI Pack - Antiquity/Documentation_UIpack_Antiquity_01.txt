This asset pack contains everything you'll need to build a User Interface with elements befitting a world set in antiquity - that is, prior to the middle ages. However, it may also suit a fantasy setting!

Includes Heads Up Display assets such as bars, icons, buttons and frames - the latter of which are tile-able. Most everything is scaled to power of two and is divisible by 8, except the smallest of assets.

---  ASSETS 128px to 1024 (72dpi)  ---
- Health, Mana, Energy and Stamina Bar textures
- Two styles of avian header artwork with color varieties

Multiple button textures with art for states (default, hover and pressed)
- Two styles of UI frame, 9-sliced for ease of tiling
- Slider frame and tab textures
- 3 sizes of button framework and a 9-sliced frame, so you can build your own borders!
- 18 different button icon textures for the range of user needs within the interface (chr sheet, inv, store, achievements, options etc!)

- PSD file included, so you can make changes to the art work to suit your needs!
